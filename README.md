# D-real social app

D-real social app is written in .NET for an Information Systems class at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science University of Ljubljana. <br><br>
The idea behind the app is to create a new social app that will not sell data and have an algorithmic content prediction. We want to create a social app where we will see posts from our real friends and not only conspiracy theory posts.
